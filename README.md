Project Summary: Exploratory Data Analysis on Retail Sales Data
This project involved performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a retail sales dataset to uncover trends, customer behaviors, and product performance. The analysis was conducted in several key steps:

1. Data Loading and Cleaning
The project began by loading two datasets: Retail Sales Data and Menu Data. Initial checks confirmed that the datasets were clean, with no missing values, and the data types were correctly configured, including converting the 'Date' column to a datetime format for time-series analysis.

2. Descriptive Statistics
Descriptive statistics were generated for both datasets to understand the central tendencies, spread, and distribution of key numerical and categorical variables.

The Retail Sales Data showed a diverse customer base with ages ranging from 18 to 64. The average transaction amount was \$456, with a standard deviation of nearly \$560, indicating a wide range of purchase values.

The Menu Data provided nutritional information, with an average of 368 calories per item, but a wide range from 0 to 1880 calories.

3. Time Series Analysis
A time-series plot of daily total sales was created to visualize sales trends over time. The plot revealed fluctuations in daily sales, which could be further analyzed to identify seasonal patterns or specific high-performing dates.

4. Customer and Product Analysis
A detailed analysis was performed to understand customer demographics and product popularity.

Top Product Categories: The Clothing category was the most popular by quantity sold (894 units), followed by Electronics (849) and Beauty (771).

Sales by Gender: Female customers contributed more to total sales, with \$232,840 compared to \$223,160 from male customers.

Average Customer Age: The average age of customers was similar across all product categories, hovering around 40-42 years old, indicating a broad appeal.

5. Visualization and Insights
Visualizations were used to make the insights more intuitive:

A bar chart of total sales by product category confirmed that Clothing generated the highest sales, followed by Electronics and Beauty. - A histogram of customer ages showed the distribution of customers, which appeared to be fairly uniform across the age groups. - A heatmap of total sales by gender and product category provided a clear overview of which gender preferred which product, with notable sales figures for Clothing among both male and female customers.

6. Recommendations
Based on the analysis, the following data-driven recommendations were formulated to improve business strategy:

Product Promotion: Since Clothing has the highest sales, launching a campaign for new clothing arrivals or seasonal discounts could further boost revenue.

Targeted Marketing: The consistent average age across categories suggests a broad marketing approach is effective, but for underrepresented age groups, a targeted social media campaign could be used.

Seasonal Sales Events: Analyzing sales trends more deeply could help identify low-performing months, allowing for the strategic planning of special discount events to stabilize revenue throughout the year.
